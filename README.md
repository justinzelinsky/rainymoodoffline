# Rainy Mood Offline

I took a Rainy Mood extension which just loaded the website in the background and made it so that you have the actual
rain audio file, so it works offline.

The images were a part of another Rainy Mood extension but I cannot seem to find the source to give credit -- I didn't create them.

# How to install

Download (or clone) this repository.

In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and click _Load unpacked extension..._, and select the downloaded folder.
