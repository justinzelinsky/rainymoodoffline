Rainy Mood Offline
==================

I took a Rainy Mood extension which just loaded the website in the background and made it so that you have the actual
rain audio file, so it works offline.

The images were a part of another Rainy Mood extension but I cannot seem to find the source to give credit -- I didn't create them.


How to install
==============

Download (or clone) this repository.

In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and click *Load unpacked extension...*, and select the downloaded folder.
